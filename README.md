# Arch Linux: A Personal Learning Documentation

A living documentation of my journey learning Arch Linux from manual installation to daily use. This project chronicles the process of building understanding through hands-on experience.

## 📖 About

This book documents my experience installing and configuring Arch Linux, built incrementally as I learn. Rather than attempting to be a comprehensive guide, it captures the actual learning process—decisions made, problems encountered, and solutions discovered.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Personal reference**: Documentation for future installations and troubleshooting
- **Learning record**: Tracking my understanding of Linux system architecture
- **Shared knowledge**: If others find value in following a learner's perspective

## 🏗️ Structure

The book is organized chronologically based on my learning path:

1. **Manual Installation**: Understanding system fundamentals through hands-on installation
2. **Desktop Environment**: Building a usable graphical interface (in progress)
3. **Daily Configuration**: Customizations discovered through actual use (upcoming)
4. **Advanced Topics**: Deep dives as I encounter them (upcoming)

## 🚀 Built With

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) - Technical documentation framework
- Markdown/QMD - Content format
- Git - Version control for tracking learning progression
